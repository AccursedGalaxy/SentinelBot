# Feature Ideas
- Continously track the "trending" coins from CoiGecko.
--> store the trending coins in a database and update the trending coins every 5 minutes.
--> Then use this data to gather statistics and send updates into a discord channel.
--> Updates like: Current Trending Coins, Coins that are no longer trending, Coins that are new to the trending list, etc.
--> Also stuff like What coins are trending again, what coins are trending for the first time, coins that are trending for the longest time etc.

---> The end goal here should be to send regular updates into a discord channel that are offer insights into current trending coins that go beyond checking them on coingecko.

- Create Signals for Big Movers
--> Create a signal for coins that have moved more than 15% in the last 24 hours and send them into a discord channel.
