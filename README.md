## Main Components

### main.py

This is the entry point of the bot. It sets up logging, the bot object, signal handling for graceful shutdown, and database table creation. It also loads all cogs (extensions) and starts the bot.

### cogs

#### admin.py

Defines administrative commands for the bot. These can include moderation tasks, server management, etc.

#### help.py

Provides a help command that lists all available commands or detailed help for a specific command.

### config

#### settings.py

Contains settings for the bot, such as token, database URL, and other environment-specific settings.

### data

#### db.py

Handles database connections, session management, and provides utility functions for executing queries.

#### models.py

Defines SQLAlchemy models for database tables.

### utils

#### decorators.py

Provides decorators for command functions, adding checks like whether the user is the bot creator or an admin.

#### paginators.py

Utility for creating paginated messages in Discord, useful for commands that return large amounts of data.

## Requirements

List of Python packages required is in `requirements.txt`. Install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running the Bot

Execute `main.py` to run the bot. Ensure all environment variables are set as defined in `settings.py`.
